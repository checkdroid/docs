Test Creation
====================================================

We have built tools to make test creation a breeze. Typically, automation engineers spend hours to days writing test cases and our goal is bring this down to few seconds to minutes.

Here we list our different initiatives for test creation. Please reach out to us at info@checkdroid.com with your requirements.

Barista app for Android
------------------------

The Barista app takes a novel approach to use the Android Accessibility Service for observing actions on an app under test, and 
provides an overlay for capturing assertions/checks.

Getting your tests
__________________


There are several ways to get your tests generated by Barista.

1. **Email:** By default Barista emails the generated test, as an attachment to the user that signed in with their Google account.
2. **Web:** You can get your tests by signing in with the same Google account on our web app -- https://app.checkdroid.com . The web interface also allows you to customize (i.e., change selectors) the test before downloading.
3. **Gradle:** The best way to get your tests is to directly download
